My troubles with Apple.

Being a developer for about 3 years and used wondiws for about  decade may be, finally presented with Apple, a linux system, well not exactly, i have used ubuntu before, that but ohh boy, this is a lot :unamused:.

Since I was presented this on the job. I got two convinent monitors along with it. So first thing I wanted to do was make it extended, but extended horizontally.
