My troubles with Apple.

Being a developer for about 3 years and used wondiws for about  decade may be, finally presented with Apple, a linux system, well not exactly, i have used ubuntu before, that but ohh boy, this is a lot :unamused:.

Since I was presented this on the job. I got two convinent monitors along with it. So first thing I wanted to do was make it extended, but extended horizontally.

## Chrome crawling
Nostalogic missing the chrome. I am about to install it. And I need to open my downloads folder. First I thought to look at the file manager for downloads folder in the bottom task bar. But it could also be on the teminal in the unix folder setting.


## Setting up the Mailbox

This looked fine, I clicked on the Mail icon nothing seemed to open, then I open a mailbox from menu and started the wizard.
