My troubles with Apple.

Being a developer for about 3 years and used wondiws for about  decade may be, finally presented with Apple, a linux system, well not exactly, i have used ubuntu before, that but ohh boy, this is a lot :unamused:.

Since I was presented this on the job. I got two convinent monitors along with it. So first thing I wanted to do was make it extended, but extended horizontally.

## Chrome crawling
Nostalogic missing the chrome. I am about to install it. And I need to open my downloads folder. First I thought to look at the file manager for downloads folder in the bottom task bar. But it could also be on the teminal in the unix folder setting.

Later I found a arrow pointing to the browser downloads folder icon besides the url bar. Installed it.

## Setting up the Mailbox

This looked fine, I clicked on the Mail icon nothing seemed to open, then I open a mailbox from menu and started the wizard.

## Setting up a printer


## Store for your 
As a developer I intend to use slack. I tried to install thorugh app store. Out of nowhere it asks me associate an apple id with the store. And takes to the payment section - mandatory :open_mouth: -  for entereing the credit card details.

## 

As a developer you know I tend to use github a lot, there is this time we want to use github and open the repo in github desktop. For some reason the github desktop won't give me a window in Mac, _I know the reason, I think the application executable I downloaded was not accessible for opening the repo_. Now I have to figure out how I should be opening the repo in the github desktop.

## git

I first time I hit git on the terminal,it asked me ina typical linux way to install developer tools before hand.

## Wine for your troubles

If I cant get my windows back .. I will just use wine like I use on any other linux machine to get my favourite sofware running. [2]
